								<p> I hold a master's degree in mechanical engineering with a specialization in mechanics and design. My graduate research focused on robotics, utilizing my C++ programming skills gained from past academic coursework. 
									Additionally, my exposure to ROS simulation environments required proficiency in Python, which I quickly acquired due to my C++ background. Furthering my interest in data-driven disciplines, I took courses in mechatronics, bio-inspired computing, and advanced MATLAB, where I delved into deep learning algorithms and computer vision. These experiences solidified my passion for data science, leading me to pursue a career in this field. </p>
								<p> Subsequent to graduating, I embarked on a journey of self-reflection, recognizing my desire to specialize in data science. Currently, I am employed as a research assistant in the data analytics field at the University of Toledo, actively engaged in exciting projects outlined in my resume. 
									Through personal projects, I have gained exposure in data analytics tools such as SQL, Tableau, and Excel. Alongside my professional endeavors, I continuously expand my knowledge of machine learning algorithms and try solving Leet code problems.</p>	
							    <p> Recognizing the vastness of the data science field, I have established a structured learning path to continuously upskill and refine my expertise. I am committed to staying abreast of the latest advancements in data analysis and machine learning, ensuring my ability to contribute effectively to this dynamic field.</p>
			             	    <p>My mechanical engineering background has equipped me with a strong foundation in mechanical design. I am a Certified SolidWorks Professional (CSWP) and have successfully completed projects that showcase my design for manufacturing and assembly expertise. 
									I have attached my design resume highlighting my design accomplishments in the link below for your reference. The updated resume is attached on the resume page.</p>
